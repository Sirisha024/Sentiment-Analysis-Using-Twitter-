# Sentiment Analysis Using Twitter

## Project Overview
This project focuses on sentiment analysis using Twitter data to classify tweets as positive, negative, or neutral. Given the concise and diverse nature of Twitter content, the project leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques and the Naive Bayes classifier to handle challenges like slang, emojis, and brevity in tweets.

## Objective
The main goal is to build a reliable sentiment classifier that can interpret Twitter's distinct language patterns and deliver insights into public opinion across various topics. This can be valuable for industries seeking to understand consumer sentiment or predict market trends.

## Dataset
The project uses a pre-existing dataset of tweets, with over 500,000 entries. Each tweet includes metadata such as user ID, timestamp, and text content, allowing for in-depth sentiment analysis.

## Methods and Algorithms
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Noise removal, normalization, tokenization, and stopword removal.
2. **Feature Extraction**: TF-IDF vectorization to convert tweets into numerical data for analysis.
3. **Machine Learning Model**: Naive Bayes Classifier is used for its efficiency and accuracy in text classification.

## Implementation
The implementation is structured as follows:
- **Setup and Environment**: Python with libraries like NLTK, scikit-learn, and Pandas.
- **Data Collection**: Utilizes a dataset with essential tweet metadata.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Insightful visualizations to understand tweet characteristics.
- **Model Development and Evaluation**: Model tuning with accuracy, precision, and recall metrics, and confusion matrix analysis.

## Results
The Naive Bayes model achieved an overall accuracy of 77%, indicating a reliable performance in classifying sentiments.

## Future Work
Future work could integrate audio and video sentiment analysis, implementing a multimodal approach that combines text, audio, and visual cues for more nuanced sentiment insights.

## References
The project references several key studies in sentiment analysis to support the model's methodology and evaluation criteria.
